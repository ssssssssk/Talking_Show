Many years ago Steve and I spent a few weeks together in Marfa, TX. During that time we saw many, many nice chairs. Most were made of wood or metal. What we didnâ€™t know then, but do know now, is that there are many, many, many more chairs made of plastic. Bryan Ropar was in this week to bring some of those chairs to our attention.
